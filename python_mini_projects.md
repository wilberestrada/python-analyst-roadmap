# Python Roadmap â€“ Mini Projects Guide

This document connects each learning topic in the roadmap with a practical mini-project.  
Goal: ensure every concept is applied in a realistic Data Analysis scenario.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Basic Level

### Environment, Git and Workflow
- **Mini-project:** Create a GitHub repository with an initial script.  
- Example: `age_in_days.py` (calculate age in days from birthdate).

### Language Fundamentals
- **Mini-project:** CLI script that receives user input and validates data.  
- Example: temperature converter with `try/except`.

### Data Structures
- **Mini-project:** Simple inventory system.  
- Operations: add, search, remove products using lists/dictionaries.

### Functions and Modules
- **Mini-project:** Refactor the inventory into reusable functions and split into modules.

### Generators
- **Mini-project:** Large file processor.  
- Example: read a `.txt` file line by line and calculate total transactions without loading everything into memory.

### File Handling
- **Mini-project:** Sales summary.  
- Example: read a `.txt` file with daily sales and generate a summary report into a new file.

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level

### Pandas + NumPy
- **Mini-project:** Analysis of a real dataset (CSV).  
- Tasks: cleaning, grouping, statistical summary.

### Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- **Mini-project:** Plot results from the dataset.  
- Charts: bar plots, line plots, histograms.

### Applied Statistics
- **Mini-project:** Exploratory analysis.  
- Tasks: mean, median, standard deviation, correlations.

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level

### OOP (Classes and Objects)
- **Mini-project:** Simulation of clients and bank accounts.  
- Operations: deposit, withdraw, calculate interest.

### APIs and Web Scraping
- **Mini-project:** Consume a public API (e.g., weather or cryptocurrency) and save results into CSV.

### Databases (SQL with Python)
- **Mini-project:** Simple ETL pipeline.  
- Example: load CSVs into SQLite or BigQuery and execute queries.

### Automation + Power BI
- **Final Project:** Complete Data Analysis Dashboard.  
- Pipeline: extraction â†’ transformation â†’ loading â†’ visualization.
